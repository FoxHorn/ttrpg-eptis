<h1>🌟 Eptis RPG System Unity Application 🌟</h1>
<p>Welcome to the <strong>Eptis RPG System Unity Application</strong> repository! This project is an application developed using Unity for the Eptis RPG system, which includes both a <strong>launcher</strong> and the <strong>main application</strong>.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The <strong>Launcher</strong> serves as a tool to check for new versions of the main application and to update the client accordingly. 🚀</p>
<p>The <strong>Main Application</strong> contains:</p>
<ul>
    <li>📖 A <strong>Player's Book</strong> that outlines the rules of the Eptis RPG system.</li>
    <li>👥 A <strong>Character List</strong> where players can manage their characters.</li>
    <li>📝 An <strong>Interactive Character Sheet</strong> that allows players to track their character's details and progress.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About the Eptis RPG System</h2>
<p>The <strong>Eptis RPG system</strong> is designed for fantasy/dark fantasy storytelling, whether within the lore of the system or for standalone stories and adventures. 🌌</p> 
<p>To play, you will need just a few dice:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>1d100</strong> 🎲: The primary die used for checks (except in combat, where attack and defense rolls include modifiers based on the character's level).</li>
    <li><strong>1d2-4d2; 1d4-4d4; 1d6-6d6; 1d12-12d12</strong> 🎲: Dice used for damage from afflictions (such as burning, poison, etc.) and some types of healing.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>All necessary dice are already integrated into the application.</em> 🃏</p>
<p>The interactive character sheet features:</p>
<ul>
    <li>✨ Descriptive sections for the character (name, chosen race, backstory, avatar).</li>
    <li>⚔️ Skills and proficiencies (profession, weapon mastery, control of seals, and personality attributes).</li>
    <li>📜 Separate pages for learned professions and pantheons.</li>
    <li>❤️ Interactive health and experience bars, player equipment, coin count, a resting system, combat dice rolls, and current status effects (such as burning, poisoning, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<p>To participate in the game, you need <strong>2-5 people</strong>: a Master, the application/character sheet, and a willingness to play. During the game, the Master will narrate the adventure's plot, allowing your characters to interact with each other and the world around them. 🌍</p>
<p>As you engage in the adventure, the Master may request a luck check (<strong>1d100</strong>). Players also have full opportunities to make their requests for role-playing. 🎭</p>
<h3>Example Interaction:</h3>
<p><strong>Master:</strong> "Before you lies a vast and beautiful lake. It is clear that fish inhabit it..."</p>
<p><strong>Player:</strong> "I want to start fishing; I have a fishing rod!" 🎣</p>
<p><strong>Master:</strong> "Please roll a d100 (luck check) at a difficulty of 45* to determine the outcome of your request."</p>
<p><em>The difficulty of the roll is determined by the Master. For certain character conditions, the difficulty is preset!</em> ⏳</p>
<p>For more details, feel free to explore our system and create a character based on it. We look forward to seeing you in-game! 🎉</p>
